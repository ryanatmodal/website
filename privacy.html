            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;"><em>Last Updated: December 3, 2025</em></p>
            <p>Modal Mobility Corp (“Modal,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your personal information when you use our mobile applications, websites, or SaaS platform (collectively, the “Services”) to provide on-demand multimodal transit solutions in partnership with public transit providers and enterprise customers (each a “Transit Partner”).</p>
            <p>In most cases, we provide our Services on behalf of a Transit Partner so that you can access their transportation services through our platform. When we do so, Modal generally acts as a service provider or processor for the Transit Partner, and the Transit Partner is the primary controller of your trip and location data. The Transit Partner may have its own privacy policy that applies to information it collects or receives. This Privacy Policy describes Modal’s practices with respect to personal information we process in connection with delivering the Services.</p>
            <p><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>
            <p>We collect the following categories of personal information:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Account and Profile Information:</strong> Name, email address, phone number, and (where applicable) profile photo, payment information, accessibility needs, or other preferences you provide when creating an account or booking a trip.</li>
            <li><strong>Trip and Location Data:</strong> Pick-up and drop-off locations, real-time location while using the app (if you grant permission), trip routes, and vehicle location information necessary to provide and optimize rides.</li>
            <li><strong>Driver and Dispatcher Information:</strong> For drivers and dispatchers using our platform, we may collect driver’s license details, vehicle information (make, model, license plate, photos), background check results (where required by the Transit Partner), and performance ratings.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> Payment card details or banking information processed through trusted third-party payment processors (we do not store full payment card numbers).</li>
            <li><strong>Communications and Support Data:</strong> Records of your interactions with us, including support requests, feedback, and ratings.</li>
            <li><strong>Device and Usage Data:</strong> IP address, device identifiers, browser type, operating system, and information about how you interact with the Services.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong></p>
            <p>We use personal information to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Provide, operate, and improve the Services, including matching riders with vehicles, routing, and real-time trip tracking.</li>
            <li>Facilitate payments and communicate trip updates, receipts, and service messages.</li>
            <li>Ensure safety, prevent fraud, and conduct automated processes such as trip matching, route optimization, and fraud detection.</li>
            <li>Comply with legal obligations and respond to law enforcement or regulatory requests.</li>
            <li>Generate anonymized or aggregated data for analytics, research, and service improvement (this data cannot identify you).</li>
            <li>With your consent where required, send promotional communications (you may opt out at any time).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Automated Decision-Making</strong></p>
            <p>We use automated processes for trip matching, routing, pricing, fraud detection, and service optimization. These processes may produce significant effects but always include human oversight or the ability to request review when required by law.</p>
            <p><strong>Sharing of Personal Information</strong></p>
            <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information. We share personal information only as follows:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>With Transit Partners:</strong> Trip and location data necessary to fulfill the transportation service is owned by and shared with the relevant Transit Partner.</li>
            <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> Trusted third parties (e.g., cloud hosting, mapping services such as Google Maps, payment processors, analytics providers) who assist us in operating the Services and who are contractually obligated to protect your information.</li>
            <li><strong>With Other Users as Needed:</strong> Limited information (e.g., first name, pick-up location, ratings) may be visible to drivers, riders, or dispatchers to facilitate safe and efficient service.</li>
            <li><strong>For Legal Purposes:</strong> When required by law, to protect rights and safety, or in connection with a business transfer (merger, acquisition, etc.).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Location and trip data shared with third parties (e.g., mapping APIs) is anonymized whenever possible and used only as necessary to perform the Services.</p>
            <p><strong>Data Storage and Security</strong></p>
            <p>Your personal information is stored and processed in secure data centers located in the United States. We implement industry-standard technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, or disclosure.</p>
            <p><strong>Your Choices and Rights</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>You may access, correct, update, or delete your account information at any time through the app or by contacting us.</li>
            <li>You may opt out of marketing communications by following the unsubscribe instructions in messages or adjusting your account settings.</li>
            <li>You can disable location sharing in your device settings (note this may limit functionality).</li>
            <li>Depending on your location and applicable law, you may have additional rights such as data portability, objection to processing, or restriction of processing. To exercise these rights, contact us at the address below.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Data Retention</strong></p>
            <p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary to provide the Services, fulfill legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Trip and location data is generally retained only for the period required by the Transit Partner or applicable law.</p>
            <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>
            <p>Our Services are not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without appropriate parental consent.</p>
            <p><strong>Changes to This Policy</strong></p>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes via the Services or by email. Your continued use of the Services after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
