                <h2>Why Make This Public?  &nbsp; Because It Sets Us Apart.</h2>
                <p>Much of the microtransit industry makes bold claims without providing the data to back them up. At Modal, we believe transit agencies deserve to know the evidence behind the systems they operate.</p>
                <p>These papers show <b>why Modal consistently outperforms alternatives</b>: our optimization models and algorithms are <b>the most advanced in the field</b>, backed by a research-to-commercial pipeline that keeps us ahead.</p>
                <p>Of course, we protect our core IP, and many of our key algorithms remain private.  But sharing some of the science allows transit providers to see the caliber of our product.</p>
