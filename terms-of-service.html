            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;"><em>Last Updated: December 3, 2025</em></p>
            <p>Modal Mobility Corp (“Modal,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) provides on-demand multimodal transit SaaS solutions, including software and technology-enabled services to enable transit providers and enterprise customers to optimize first- and last-mile multimodal and microtransit services. Our platform is used by public transit agencies, cities, and other organizations across the United States to facilitate efficient, equitable mobility.</p>
            <p>Please read these Terms carefully as they constitute a binding contract between you and Modal.</p>
            <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) do not apply to any separate agreements with Modal’s enterprise customers or transit partners, which may have their own terms.</p>
            <p><strong>1. Contractual Relationship</strong></p>
            <p>These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you (an individual or entity) and Modal governing your access to and use of the Modal Services as defined below.</p>
            <p>Please be advised that these Terms contain provisions that govern how claims between you and Modal can be brought, including the arbitration agreement in Section 10 below. Please review the arbitration agreement carefully, as it requires you to resolve all disputes with Modal on an individual basis and, with limited exceptions, through final and binding arbitration. By using the Modal Services and thereby agreeing to these Terms, you expressly acknowledge that you have read and understand these Terms and have taken time to consider the consequences of agreeing to arbitration and all other provisions in Section 10.</p>
            <p><strong>Accepting the Terms</strong></p>
            <p>You accept and agree to these Terms each time you access or use the Modal Services.</p>
            <p>If you do not accept or agree to any of these Terms, you may not access or use the Modal Services.</p>
            <p><strong>Changes to the Terms</strong></p>
            <p>These Terms are subject to change by Modal in its sole discretion at any time. We encourage you to visit this page periodically to review the most current Terms. We may also modify any information contained in the pages or policies incorporated into the Terms by reference. Your continued use of the Modal Services after a change to these Terms constitutes your binding acceptance of these Terms.</p>
            <p>We will notify you of any such change to the Terms by changing the last updated date at the top of the Terms. We may also elect to provide an additional notice of changes by email or push notification through the Modal Services.</p>
            <p>To the extent you were provided with an opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement in Section 10, you agree that changes to these Terms do not create a renewed opportunity to opt out of arbitration.</p>
            <p><strong>Additional Terms</strong></p>
            <p>We may make additional terms, conditions, or policies available to you from time to time that also govern your use of the Modal Services (the “Additional Terms”). The Additional Terms will be deemed a part of these Terms for purposes of any applicable offer or service, but if any Additional Terms conflict with these Terms, the Additional Terms (and not these Terms) will prevail.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Modal Services</strong></p>
            <p>The Modal Services that are governed by these Terms are: (i) the websites that Modal creates, hosts, owns, controls, develops, or otherwise makes available (the “Modal Websites”), (ii) the mobile applications that Modal creates, hosts, owns, controls, develops, or otherwise makes available to Riders, Drivers, and Dispatchers (the “Modal Apps”), and (iii) the platforms, dashboards, content, products, and related interfaces, tools, and services that Modal makes available to Enterprise Customers (collectively, the “Modal Services”).</p>
            <p>“Enterprise Customers” are public transit agencies, cities, corporations, and other institutional customers which use the Modal Services to establish, monitor, optimize, operate, and/or manage multimodal transit networks, including first- and last-mile microtransit services.</p>
            <p>Please note that certain Modal Services may be governed by alternative terms instead of these Terms where provided by an Enterprise Customer on a SaaS basis. In those cases, the Enterprise Customer may create their own terms and conditions, which will govern your access and use of their services.</p>
            <p>There are several categories of individual “Users” who may access the Modal Services and whose relationship with Modal may be governed by these Terms (along with any Additional Terms):</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Riders:</strong> Individuals who use the Modal Services to request transportation (or information about transportation) for themselves or others, as well as those who receive such services. Riders may be individuals who did not create a User Account but who are traveling with an account holder.</li>
            <li><strong>Drivers:</strong> Individuals who provide transportation services by using the Modal Services. Drivers are independent contractors with no employment relationship with Modal.</li>
            <li><strong>Dispatchers:</strong> Individuals who manage or dispatch vehicles using the Modal Services on behalf of Enterprise Customers.</li>
            <li><strong>Enterprise Platform Users:</strong> Employees, agents, consultants, or subcontractors of Enterprise Customers.</li>
            <li><strong>Visitors:</strong> All other individuals who interact with the Modal Services without completing registration for a User Account.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Throughout these Terms, any request for transportation services is referred to as a “Reservation.”</p>
            <p>Modal offers users information and a method to arrange for transportation services through partner transit providers. You acknowledge that your ability to arrange for or obtain transportation services using the Modal Services does not establish Modal as a provider of those services. Independent drivers and transit providers are solely responsible for offering any transportation services which may be arranged through the Modal Services. Modal has no responsibility or liability for any transportation services provided to you by independent drivers or transit providers.</p>
            <p>You acknowledge that independent drivers and any other independent third-party service providers who may use the Modal Services are not employees, actual agents, apparent agents, or ostensible agents of Modal in any way. You further acknowledge that any effort, feature, process, policy, or standard undertaken by Modal in the interest of public safety (whether or not required by applicable statute or regulation) or as a requirement of Modal’s contractual arrangement with an Enterprise Customer is not evidence of an employment, actual agency, apparent agency, or ostensible agency relationship between Modal and any driver.</p>
            <p><strong>Changes to the Modal Services</strong></p>
            <p>You acknowledge that the Modal Services and all characteristics of the third-party transportation services that can be accessed through the Modal Services are subject to change at any time without notice. You also acknowledge that you may be required to accept updates to the Modal Apps or other third-party software you have installed on your computer or mobile device in order to continue to use the Modal Services.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Access to the Modal Services</strong></p>
            <p><strong>User Accounts and Credentials</strong></p>
            <p>To use the Modal Services as a Rider, Driver, Dispatcher, or Enterprise Platform User, you may be required to create an account (“User Account”). You agree not to create more than one User Account for any separately branded product or service available through the Modal Services. Modal reserves the right to deactivate any additional or duplicate User Accounts. You may not create a User Account for someone else unless you have the legal authority or other valid authorization to do so on their behalf. Enterprise Platform Users may create User Accounts for Riders and Drivers only if authorized to do so by Modal.</p>
            <p>You agree not to provide any false information for purposes of creating a User Account or accessing the Modal Services. You are solely responsible for maintaining accurate, complete, and up-to-date information in your User Account.</p>
            <p>Your User Account is personal to you, and you may not share your access credentials with, or allow access to your User Account by, any third party. You are responsible for the confidentiality and security of your User Account and you agree to preserve the confidentiality of your access credentials and the security of any device that you use to access the Modal Services. You agree to notify Modal immediately by emailing legal@ridemodal.com regarding any known or suspected breach of security, including any third party’s access to your User Account or any loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of the access credentials to your User Account. You will be solely responsible for any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind incurred by Modal and others arising from or related to your failure to maintain the confidentiality and security of your User Account.</p>
            <p><strong>Responsibility for Other Users</strong></p>
            <p>You will be responsible for all activity that occurs under your User Account and access credentials. For example, if you are a Rider and you make a Reservation for transportation services to be used by any other individual, you are responsible for that individual’s behavior and use of the services arranged through the Modal Services. Note that when you make a Reservation for transportation services, you must indicate how many individuals are traveling in your party. If you do not accurately report this information when making a Reservation, you or your guests may not be accommodated and you may be subject to additional Fees.</p>
            <p><strong>Access by Minors Restricted</strong></p>
            <p>The Modal Services are not directed to children, and we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information directly from children under 13. If you are under 13, please do not use the Modal Services or otherwise provide us with any personal information without parental or guardian consent. Children may only receive transportation reserved through the Modal Services if the request is made by a parent, guardian, or other authorized adult.</p>
            <p>No person under the age of 18 may create a User Account or use the Modal Services without the consent of a parent or guardian. If you are a minor in the jurisdiction in which you reside (generally, under the age of 18), you must have the permission of your parent or legal guardian to use the Modal Services and your parent or legal guardian must read and agree to these Terms on your behalf prior to your using the Modal Services. If you are a parent or guardian who has created an account for a minor under the age of 18, you hereby give permission and consent to the Terms on the minor’s behalf, and you shall assume any and all responsibility and liability for the minor’s use of the Modal Services as provided by these Terms.</p>
            <p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe that a child under the age of 18 has registered for or used the Modal Services without your consent, please contact us at legal@ridemodal.com.</p>
            <p><strong>Agent of an Organization</strong></p>
            <p>If you are using the Modal Services on behalf of any organization, agency, or corporate entity (including an Enterprise Customer), then you represent and warrant that you: (1) are an authorized representative of that organization; (2) have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms; and (3) agree to be bound by these Terms on behalf of that organization.</p>
            <p><strong>Network Access and Devices</strong></p>
            <p>You are responsible for obtaining access to the internet, data network, and compatible hardware or devices necessary to use the Modal Services. Your mobile network’s data and messaging rates and fees may apply if you access or use the Modal Services from your mobile device. Modal does not guarantee that any component of the Modal Services will function on any particular hardware or device. In addition, the Modal Services may be subject to malfunctions and delays inherent in the use of the Internet and electronic communications.</p>
            <p><strong>Restriction and Termination of Access</strong></p>
            <p>Modal reserves the right to temporarily or permanently restrict your User Account and your access to the Modal Services at its sole discretion and for any reason. Further, Modal may in its sole discretion and without liability modify, suspend, or discontinue at any time, with or without notice, any aspect of the Modal Services or the third-party services offered to you through the Modal Services. Please see the Termination and Account Restrictions section below for additional information related to the termination of access to the Modal Services.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Fees and Payments</strong></p>

            <p>You acknowledge that Modal may charge you fees, taxes, and/or surcharges for your access to the Modal Services, your use of the Modal Services to make Reservations, and for conduct, conditions, and incidents that occur in connection with the transportation services that you reserve or receive through the use of the Modal Services (collectively, “Fees”).

            <li><strong>Cleaning/Damage Fees.</strong> Cleaning or damage Fees may be assessed and charged to you if a Driver’s vehicle’s interior or exterior is damaged or dirtied as a result of your or your guest(s)’s intentional, reckless, or negligent acts (including aggressive slamming of doors, vomiting, or pet hair).

            <li><strong>Cancellation or No-Show Fees.</strong> If you cancel a Reservation or are not present at the time and place designated in your Reservation, Modal may charge you Fees for cancellations or no-shows.

            <p><strong>5. Promotions</strong></p>

            <p><strong>10. Arbitration Agreement & Dispute Resolution</strong></p>
            <p>Please review this section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully, as it will require you to resolve disputes with Modal on an individual basis through final and binding arbitration, except as expressly provided below. By agreeing to this Arbitration Agreement, you waive your right to have a trial by jury and your right to serve as a representative, as a private attorney general, or in any other representative capacity, or to participate as a member of a class of claimants, in any lawsuit, except as expressly provided below.</p>
            <p>You have the right to consult with counsel of your choice concerning the Arbitration Agreement and to be represented by counsel at any stage in the arbitration process.</p>
            <p><strong>A. Mutual Agreement to Binding Arbitration</strong></p>
            <p>You and Modal Mobility Corp and its subsidiaries and affiliates (“Modal” or the “Company”) agree that, except as expressly provided in Subsection B (“Limited Exceptions to Arbitration”), any and all disputes, claims, or disagreements, whether past, present, or future, which arise out of or relate in any way to (i) this Agreement and this Arbitration Agreement and any of their respective prior versions (including the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, scope, waiver, or validity of the Terms and the Arbitration Agreement), (ii) the Transportation Services (including any incidents or accidents in connection with such services), (iii) your access to or use of the Modal Platform or any other tools or services provided by the Company, (iv) transactions involving you and the Company or payments by or to the Company (including claims regarding compensation or benefits), (v) your relationship with the Company, (vi) any communications, including marketing communications, drafted or distributed by the Company or by any third party on its behalf, and (vii) any other dispute with the Company (“Claims”), shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration between you and the Company, and not by any federal, state, or local court, jury trial, or agency.</p>
            <p>For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, the terms “you” and “Company” also include each entity’s respective parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, and assigns, and their respective owners, directors, officers, executives, employees, shareholders, and agents.</p>
            <p>This Arbitration Agreement shall be binding upon and shall extend to any Claims brought by or against any third parties and third-party beneficiaries (including your spouses, heirs, and assigns). The Company’s service providers, including background check providers and payment processors, shall be considered intended third-party beneficiaries of this Arbitration Agreement and may also enforce this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
            <p>The parties understand that arbitration means that an arbitrator, and not a judge or jury will adjudicate the claim, and that rights to appeals or to discovery or other exchanges of information may be limited in arbitration. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you and the Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
            <p><strong>B. Limited Exceptions to Arbitration</strong></p>
            <p>Notwithstanding Subsection A (“Mutual Agreement to Binding Arbitration”) and without waiving the enforceability of the Arbitration Agreement as to any other Claim or to the class and representative action waivers in Subsection J (“Class and Coordinated Action Waiver”), each party retains the right to: (i) resolve a Claim in small claims court, so long as it is within that court’s jurisdiction, the Claim is adjudicated only on an individual basis and not on a class or collective action basis, and the Claim remains in that small claims court; (ii) seek injunctive or other equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (including patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets or other confidential or proprietary information, but not privacy or publicity rights); or (iii) raise individual claims of sexual assault or sexual harassment in a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>The claims listed in this Subsection B (“Limited Exceptions to Arbitration”) as express exceptions to the requirement of binding arbitration must be brought and litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction by you on an individual basis only and not on a class or collective action basis. You agree that no action brought by you under this Subsection B (“Limited Exceptions to Arbitration”) may be consolidated or joined in any fashion.</p>
